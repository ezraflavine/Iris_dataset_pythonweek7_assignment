# Iris Dataset Analysis 


##  Objective
This project involves loading, exploring, analyzing, and visualizing the classic Iris dataset using Python libraries such as **pandas**, **matplotlib**, and **seaborn**.

## Tasks Completed

### 1. Load and Explore the Dataset
- Loaded the `iris.csv` dataset using `pandas`.
- Checked for missing values and verified data types.
- Confirmed the dataset was clean and ready for analysis.

### 2. Basic Data Analysis
- Generated descriptive statistics (mean, std, min, max).
- Grouped data by `species` and calculated average measurements.
- Identified that:
  - **Virginica** has the largest petal and sepal dimensions.
  - **Setosa** is the most distinct with smaller petal lengths.

### 3. Data Visualization
Created the following plots:
- **Line Chart** – Average measurements per species
- **Bar Chart** – Average petal length per species
- **Histogram** – Sepal width distribution
- **Scatter Plot** – Sepal length vs. petal length colored by species

##  Key Insights
- **Petal length and width** are the most distinguishing features across species.
- **Species form distinct clusters** in scatter plots, useful for classification tasks.
- The dataset is clean, balanced, and ideal for supervised learning exercises.

## Files Included
- `iris.csv` – Dataset
- `iris_analysis.ipynb` or `iris_analysis.py` – Analysis code
- `sales_summary.txt` (optional, if bonus included)
- `README.md` – This file

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- pandas
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- Jupyter Notebook (optional)

## How to Run
1. Clone/download the repository.
2. Open `iris_analysis.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook **or** run the `.py` file using:
   ```bash
   python iris_analysis.py
